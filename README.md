##  How To Install WordPress 

## Synopsis

I was looking around for a useful script to speed up the setting-up process for a WordPress site.

After looking around, I found a couple of great scripts by [@snaptortoise](https://github.com/snaptortoise) and [@darlanrod](https://github.com/darlanrod). However I needed more features to speed up my day-to-day WordPress work, so I built on top of the fantastic work these guys did to get it to where I needed it to be.
